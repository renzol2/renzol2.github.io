It allows users to create, find, and view Builds containing free resources they've found helpful for learning about certain topics at an intro, intermediate, and advanced level. Tags filter Builds into relevant categories and allow users to easily start finding resources for topics that interest them. And an upvote system highlights Builds that others have used to succeed.",

      "Pan-Lang is a webapp that is able to check in patrons receiving food from a food bank to record for the local food bank. While checking in, Pan-Lang is able to provide translations for food items that the patron can request, and keep track of the stock of those items. Pan-Lang is also able to detail which patron's order has been fulfilled. To account for coordinators not wanting to use our application because of technological hurdles, we also created a paper version better than the current version to include the technologically uninclined.",
